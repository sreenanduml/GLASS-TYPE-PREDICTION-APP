                           # GLASS-TYPE-PREDICTION-APP

The Glass Type Prediction App is a machine learning project designed to classify glass materials based on their chemical composition. Built using the well-known Glass Identification Dataset, this project demonstrates how data preprocessing, model training, and interactive deployment come together to solve a real-world classification problem.

Glass identification is crucial in fields such as forensics, manufacturing, and materials science, where determining the origin or category of glass can provide valuable insights. This application provides a simple and intuitive interface where users can input chemical attributes and instantly receive an accurate prediction of the glass type.

A machine-learning powered app that predicts the type of glass based on its chemical composition. This project uses a trained classification model on the classic Glass Identification Dataset to help demonstrate ML workflows, model deployment, and an interactive prediction interface.
